# java

Remember that every Java program has a class name which must match the filename, and that every program must contain the main() method.

System.out.println("Hello World");
System is a built-in Java class that contains useful members, such as out, which is short for "output". The println() method, short for "print line", is used to print a value to the screen (or a file).
