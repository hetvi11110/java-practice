# java

Remember that every Java program has a class name which must match the filename, and that every program must contain the main() method.

<code>System.out.println("Hello World");</code></br>
System is a built-in Java class that contains useful members, such as out, which is short for "output". The println() method, short for "print line", is used to print a value to the screen (or a file).

print() method is similar to println(), the only difference is that it does not insert a new line at the end of the output.

<code>static void myMethod() {
    // code to be executed
  }</code></br>
  <b>static</b> means that the method belongs to the Main class and not an object of the Main class.</br><b>void</b> means that this method does not have a return value
