<b>Worst and Average Case Time Complexity: O(N²) - Quadratic</b> The worst case occurs when an array is reverse sorted.</br>
<b>Best Case Time Complexity: O(N) - linearly </b> The best case occurs when an array is already sorted.</br>
<b>Space Complexity: O(N²) - Quadratic</b></br>
<b>Auxiliary Space: O(1)</b> The extra space that is taken by an algorithm temporarily to finish its work.</br>
